        <h2>Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction</h2>
        <p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I used a dataset containing customer information and their churn status. I performed data preprocessing    and feature engineering to improve the model's performance. The final model achieved an accuracy of 85% and helped the company identify at-risk customers.</p>

        <h2>Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts</h2>
        <p>In this project, I analyzed social media posts to determine the sentiment of users towards a particular brand. I collected a dataset of tweets mentioning the brand and used natural language processing techniques to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The model achieved an accuracy of 90% and provided valuable insights for the brand's marketing strategy.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: Sales Forecasting</h2>
        <p>In this project, I developed a time series forecasting model to predict future sales for a retail company. I used historical sales data and external factors such as holidays and promotions to train the model. The final model achieved a mean absolute error of 500 units and helped the company optimize their inventory management and improve sales forecasting accuracy.</p>
